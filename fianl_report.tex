Overall in the document our epsilon value is 0.1, and from since we invoke the laplace mechanism 33 times, through sequential composition our total privacy budget would be 3.3

\subsection{Basic Averages}%
\label{subsec:BasicAverages}%
The bill\_amt and limit\_bal differentially private average statistics were generated using the sparse vector technique to determine a clipping parameter for the data, and then generating differentially private sums and counts to find a differentially private average.%
Whereas the remaining averages and counts were calculated using the good old laplace mechanism or in the case of the averages, we used the method for choosing a clipping which does not require thousands of queries as displayed in Homework 4%
