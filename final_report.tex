\section{Discussion}%
\label{sec:Discussion}%
It should be noted that reported dollar amounts are in the New Tiawan dollar%
\subsection{Privacy Budget}%
\label{subsec:PrivacyBudget}%
Overall in the document our epsilon value is 0.1, and from since we invoke the laplace mechanism 33 times, through sequential composition our total privacy budget would be 3.3

\section{Statistics}%
\label{sec:Statistics}%
\subsection{Basic Averages}%
\label{subsec:BasicAverages}%
The bill\_amt and limit\_bal differentially private average statistics were generated using the sparse vector technique to determine a clipping parameter for the data, and then generating differentially private sums and counts to find a differentially private average.%
Whereas the remaining averages and counts were calculated using the good old laplace mechanism or in the case of the averages, we used the method for choosing a clipping which does not require thousands of queries as displayed in Homework 4%
\subsubsection{Average Age}%
\label{ssubsec:AverageAge}%
The average age of all credit card clients is 30.86, the differentially private average age of all customers is 30.6. This gives an error of 0.82\%.

\subsubsection{Average Credit Limit Balance}%
\label{ssubsec:AverageCreditLimitBalance}%
The average credit card balance limit of all credit card customers is 167484.32, the differentially private average credit card balance limit of all customers is 90775.51. This gives an error of 45.8\%.
